xJH - Jerk Homing
---------------------------------

Sets the jerk value used for homing to stop movement when switches are hit or released.
You generally want this value to be larger than the $xJM value, as this determines how 
fast the axis will stop once it hits the switch. You generally want this as fast as you 
can get it without losing steps on the accelerations.
