xVM - Velocity Maximum
---------------------------------

(aka traverse rate or seek rate). Sets the maximum velocity the axis will move during a G0 move
(traverse). This is set in length units per minute for linear axes, degrees per minute for rotary
axes.

Note that the max velocity is per-axis. Diagonal / multi-axis traverses will actually occur at 
the fastest speed the combined set of axes and the geometry will allow, and may be faster than 
the individual axis max velocities. For example, max velocity for X and Y are set to 1000 mm/min.
For a 45 degree traverse in X and Y the toolhead would travel at 1414.21 mm/min.

 XVM = 1200   sets X maximum velocity (G0) to 1200 mm/min - assuming G21 is active (i.e. the 
              machine is in MM mode)
 ZVM = 30.0   sets Z to 30 inches per minute - assuming G20 is active (i.e. inches mode)
 AVM = 36000  sets A to 100 revolutions per minute (360 * 100)
