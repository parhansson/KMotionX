1. Loosen all screws (with probe mounted, towards front)
2. Preload by tightening until probe moves + 1/4 turn
3. Measure V1 front and back
4. Target = Front + ((Front - Back) / 2)
   Turning wrench away makes measurement smaller
5. After getting V1 front and back the same, tweek v2 and V3 to same target.
6. Measure V1 but DO NOT CHANGE V1
7. Target = (V1 - ((V2 + V3) / 2)) / 3
8. Tweek V2 and 3 to target
9. Go to step 6
