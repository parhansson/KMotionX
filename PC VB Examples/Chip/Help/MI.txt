1MI, 2MI, 3MI, 4MI - MIcrosteps
---------------------------------

TinyG microsteps are set in firmware, not as hardware jumpers as on some other systems.
The following microstep values are supported:

    1 = no microsteps (whole steps)
    2 = half stepping
    4 = quarter stepping
    8 = eighth stepping

 3mi = 8  Set 1/8 microsteps for motor 3 

TinyG can also drive external stepper drivers using the breakout headers. Some drivers
use other values than the above, so any value is accepted. Values other than those 
above are warned as non-standard.

Note about Microsteps: It is a misconception that higher microstep values are better
beyond a certain point they are a detriment to performance. In a typical setup the 
total power delivered to the motor (and hence torque) will go down as you increase
the microsteps, especially at higher speeds. Also, using microsteps to set the finest
machine resolution is source of error as the shaft angle isn't necessarily going to
be at the theoretical point. Don't just assume that 1/8 microstepping is the right
setting for your application. Try out different settings to balance smoothness and power.
