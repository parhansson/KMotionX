Global Power Management Commands
---------------------------------

These commands affect all motors.

MD(=N) Disable motors 	    
  MD will disable all motors. Set N = 1-4 to disable motor N only This will turn off any motor
  that is not permanently enabled (nPM=1). If provided a valid motor number it will disable that
  motor only.

ME(=N) Enable motors
  ME will enable all motors. Set N = 1-4 to enable motor N only. This will turn on any motor that
  is not disabled (1PM=0). If provided a valid motor number it will enable that motor only.

MT  Set motor enable timeout   
  In seconds, up to 1 million seconds.Sets the number of seconds before a motor will shut off 
  automatically. When the timeout starts is se by context:
                                    
    Disabled motors (nPM=0) are always off. They do not time out.

    Enabled motors (nPM=1) are always on. They do not time out.

    Motors that are powered-in-cycle(nPM=2) begin timeout at the end of the cycle, which is when
    the last motor stops moving. 

    Motors that are powered-while-moving (nPM=3) begin timeout at the end of their movement


Motor timeouts are suspended during feedholds. This allows changing or adjusting tools without 
loss of position.

PWR  Report enable states
  PWR returns all motor enables states. This is like a virtual motor LED that returns 1 if
  motor N is enabled (LED is lit), 0 if not.

PWR1  Report enable state 	    
  PWRn returns a single motor state

Examples.
ME = 180    Lock all motors for 3 minutes for a tooling operation 
MD        Disable all motors
MT = 300    Set timeout to 5 minutes
PWR       Query power enabled for all motors
PWR2      Query power enabled for motor 2
