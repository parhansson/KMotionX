<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The Closed Loop Stepper 
Mode works much the same as open loop Step and Direction Output Mode except 
there is also an error feedback correction term. &nbsp;In fact, if the gains of 
the correction term (PIDs) are set to zero then the mode will behave the same as an 
open loop Step Direction Mode.&nbsp; This mode is much easier to “tune” than a stepper driven as a 
brushless motor and unlike a brushless motor there are no commutation issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;A good application for this mode is a stepper with linear 
glass scales.&nbsp; The main feature is the position feed forward with fixed gain of 1.0. &nbsp;See 
the flow diagram below.&nbsp; Without any correction it behaves just like a stepper. &nbsp; As correction gains are 
added, corrections for drift, friction, load forces, or even a miss step are 
made. &nbsp;One 
disadvantage is that the motor can still stall.&nbsp; After the stall and after 
the motion stops the servo loop could then gradually correct the position which 
could be of value in some applications.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">To Configure an axis a a Closed Loop Servo select &quot;CL Step&quot; 
as the output mode for the axis as shown below.&nbsp; Any input mode may be used 
as position feedback, but the most common is a quadrature encoder either on the 
motor shaft or as a linear glass scale.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Note that an Input gain of 1.25 is used in this example.&nbsp; 
This was calculated from the ratio of the number of &#956;Steps/rev 
to the number of encoder counts/rev.&nbsp; (A micro stepper amplifier set to 50 
microsteps/full setp and a standard stepper motor with 200 full steps/rev will 
have 10,000 &#956;Steps/rev, a rotary encoder with 2000 
lines/rev will profuce 8000 quadrature counts/rev, 10000/8000 = 1.25).&nbsp; The 
raw axis units will be in &#956;Steps.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Important PID parameters are shown below circled in red.&nbsp; 
The I (Integrator) gain of 0.01 is probably the most important.&nbsp; Your 
system may require more or less.&nbsp; Too much and the system may over shoot or 
become unstable (oscillate).&nbsp; Too little and corrections will be made 
slowly.&nbsp; Because we are measure the position and also commanding a position 
Integrator control works well.&nbsp; An integrator will ramp the output at a 
rate proportional to the amount of the error.&nbsp; This &quot;slowing as we get 
closer&quot; will result in an exponential curve approaching the target.&nbsp; 
Backlash, friction, delays, and other factors will eventually cause the system 
to overshoot and become unstable with too much gain. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Max limits may also be useful for limiting the correction.&nbsp; 
In this example the limits are set to large values.&nbsp; Limiting the max error 
to a small value will limit the maximum slew rate of the Integrator.&nbsp; Max 
Output and Max Integrator are similar for an Integrator only compensator and 
will limit the maximum amount of correction that can be made.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">A 2nd order Low Pass Filter is also used in this example to 
make the system more stable by reducing high frequency corrections.&nbsp; Note a 
cutoff frequency of 100Hz with Q 1.4 is used.&nbsp; After specifying the filter 
the Compute Button must be pressed to compute the Z domain IIR Coeffiecients 
that are downloaded and used by KFlop.</font></p>
