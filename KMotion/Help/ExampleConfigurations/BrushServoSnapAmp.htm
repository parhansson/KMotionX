<p><font face="Arial">This example configuration shows a single dc brush motor 
connected to the first of 4 available full bridge drivers on a single SnapAmp 
1000.&nbsp; A single-ended encoder is connected to KMotion's JP3 connector as 
encoder input #0 for Servo feedback.&nbsp; (The KMotion board is hidden 
underneath the SnapAmp in the photo).&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Encoders typically come 
as one of two types - differential outputs (having A+, A-, B+, B-) or single 
ended outputs (A B).&nbsp; A differential encoder may be used as a single ended 
encoder by only using the A+ and B+ signals (and leaving the A- and B- 
unconnected).&nbsp; However single ended signals are more susceptible to noise 
than differential signals.&nbsp; KMotion has 4 single ended encoder inputs.&nbsp; 
SnapAmp 1000 has 4 differential encoder inputs.&nbsp; In this example a KMotion 
single-ended encoder input is used.&nbsp; Some encoders have a index pulse that 
occurs once per revolution usually labeled as channel Z.&nbsp; In this example 
the index is not used and is not connected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u><b><a name="Configuring_the_Software">Configuring the Software</a></b></u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After the motor and encoder connections have been made, the software is 
configured and the encoder feedback and motor is tested. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">Although any of KMotion's 8 axes could be used, axis 4 will be configured 
since axes 0-3 are normally used for KMotion's on-board amplifiers.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the KMotion Executive program three screens involve setting an axis's 
configuration:&nbsp; The Configuration Screen, the Step Response Screen, and the 
Filters Screen.&nbsp; These three screens and our choice of initial settings are 
shown below:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Execute the KMotion executive program and set the Options for a single 
SnapAmp.&nbsp; See below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="SelectSingleSnap.PNG"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">On the Configuration screen Axis Channel 4 is selected, the input type is set 
to Encoder at encoder channel 0, the output type is set to DC Servo at PWM 
channel 8, and a very large following error is set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ConfigEncoderBrush.PNG" width="507" height="515"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">On the Filters Screen all filters are disabled by &quot;Clearing&quot; all filters to 
have a gain of 1.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="FiltersOff.PNG" width="760" height="491"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Step Screen servo loop (PID) parameters are set to only very low 
proportional gain.&nbsp; The max output is set to a small value that should 
still allow some motor motion.&nbsp; SnapAmp DC Servo mode outputs current 
commands in the range of -1000 to +1000 which corresponds to approximately 
-30Amps to +30 Amps.&nbsp; So a max output of 100 will limit the current to 3 
Amps.&nbsp; Although the Integrator will not be initially used we set the max 
integrator to also be 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The max error is set to a large 
number.&nbsp; The motion profile parameters are set to values that we will 
expect to eventually achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our example uses a low speed torque 
motor being driven off of only 12V.&nbsp; This encoder has 4000 counts/rev so a 
speed of 50,000 cnts/sec corresponds to 12.5 rev/sec (750 RPM).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With the Motor Power Supply tuned off, pushing the Enable button will 
download the parameters from all screens and enable the axis without any motor 
motion.&nbsp; This will allow us to ensure the axis is properly wired and 
configured as encoder input and of the correct encoder channel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="StepScreenLowGain.PNG" width="897" height="580"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u><b><a name="Testing_the_encoder">Testing the encoder</a></b></u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We can now rotate the motor/encoder shaft by hand and should observe counts 
on Axis Channel 4 on the Analog Status Screen.&nbsp; Note if one of the other 
axis's configurations also is defined as input Encoder channel 0 then that axis 
may count as well.&nbsp; The default configuration for axis 0 is Encoder input 
from channel 0.&nbsp; To avoid confusion, disable any other axis by selecting 
that axis, define the input/output types as &quot;No Input&quot; and &quot;No Output&quot;, then 
download, then disable the axis.&nbsp; To test the encoder, rotate the encoder 
and check if the expected number of counts per rev are obtained.&nbsp; Rotating 
the axis the opposite direction should count in the opposite direction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="CountsChanging.PNG" width="480" height="613"></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><u><b><a name="Testing_the_Motor_Amplifier">Testing the Motor Amplifier</a></b></u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In order to test the Motor Amplifier functionality Console commands (PWMC - 
Pulse-Width-Modulation Current Mode) will be entered to drive the motor in the 
forward and reverse direction.&nbsp; The axis should and must be disabled to 
issue these commands, otherwise they will be immediately overwritten with servo 
output commands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Small values should be used initially.&nbsp; Note: 
PWMC commands may only be used with a SnapAmp (Software Version 2.31 or later), the KMotion onboard amplifiers do 
not have current feedback mode so PWM commands should be used instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SnapAmps's PWMC current commands range from -1000 to +1000 which corresponds to 
approximately -30Amps to +30 Amps.&nbsp; So a value such as 100 might be used to 
provide a drive of 3 Amps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Before issuing the PWMC commands, SnapAmp's peak current fault levels should 
be set.&nbsp;&nbsp; After verifying that the axis is disabled (on the Analog 
Status Screen), load and execute the following program to set the peak 
current limits.&nbsp; The Fault Green LED on the SnapAmp should turn off.&nbsp; 
The &quot;I'm alive&quot; Green LED should remain blinking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="SetHighCurLimits.PNG" width="587" height="328"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Setup the Console Screen as shown below.&nbsp; Sending the commands should 
drive the motor in one direction, then no motor drive, then drive in the other 
direction respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ConsolePWMC.PNG" width="525" height="446"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4" face="Arial"><a name="Closing_the_loop">Closing the loop</a></font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If the motor and encoder are working we are ready to attempt to close the 
servo feedback loop.&nbsp; All that is required is to enable the axis by 
pressing &quot;Enable&quot; on the Step response Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally one of two 
things will occur.&nbsp; Either the axis will respond as a weak servo, or the 
servo will have positive instead of negative feedback and runaway from the 
target destination rather than toward the target destination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If the servo has positive instead of negative feedback, something should be 
reversed.&nbsp; Either the Motor leads may be reversed, the encoder signals may 
be reversed, or a Input Gain of -1 may be entered on the Configuration Screen 
(as shown below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="NegInputGain.PNG" width="346" height="105"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If the servo has proper feedback and responds as a weak servo, as the 
motor/encoder shaft is turned the servo will cause torque to restore the 
position back to where it was.&nbsp; With the example proportional gain of 0.01, 
turning the sharft 1 turn should generate an error&nbsp; of 4000 counts.&nbsp; 
4000 counts multiplied by a gain of 0.01 = 40 PWMC counts or 40 / 1000 * 30Amps 
= 1.2 Amps.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><u><b><a name="Tuning_the_Servo">Tuning the Servo</a></b></u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the servo loop is functional Servo Tuning should be performed to move 
the performance, hopefully up to the desired levels.&nbsp; Servo tuning is a 
complex subject that has been written about extensively.&nbsp; The basic idea is 
to increase the feedback gains in order to reduce following errors and speed of 
response without going unstable (oscillating wildly).&nbsp; KMotion 
has extensive plotting tools to help tune and understand how well a set of 
parameters performs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To test the current performance, disable the axis, manually move it to a 
position where it may move +10000 counts, then push the &quot;Move&quot; button.&nbsp; A 
plot such as that shown below should be observed.&nbsp; Set the plot type and 
axis selections to agree with those shown below.&nbsp; The blue plot is the 
desired path as defined by the motion profile and the motion is made for 10,000 
counts and then a second motion is made back to zero.&nbsp; The red plot is the 
measured encoder position.&nbsp; Note that the red plot attempts to follow the 
blue plot but with a large error of thousands of counts.&nbsp; Gradually 
increase the P gain (possibly by factors of 2) while pushing the Move button and 
the following error should reduce.&nbsp; At some point the system will probably go 
into oscillation and become unstable.&nbsp; It may be necessary to disable the 
axis, reduce the gain, and re-enable the axis.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="PoorPlot.PNG" width="897" height="580"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Increasing the gain 500X (from 0.01 to 5) results in a much better response.&nbsp; 
Notice the blue (desired) plot is almost completely hidden behind the red measured 
plot.&nbsp;&nbsp; However by zooming in to the purple rectangle (left click 
mouse drag) we can see oscillation.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the second plot below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="Oscillation.PNG" width="897" height="580"></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Increasing the derivative gain can often reduce 
oscillation.&nbsp; In the plot below we have set the D gain to 16.&nbsp; Notice 
the oscillation has been reduced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="DerivativeGain.PNG" width="897" height="580"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">A Bode plot is useful in understanding the frequency 
response and for designing advanced servo loop filters.&nbsp; Below is the Bode 
plot response of the system.&nbsp; Important features to look for in a Bode plot 
is where the Magnitude (blue plot) first passes through the 0 db line.&nbsp; 
This is the bandwidth of the system.&nbsp; Another important measure is the 
&quot;phase margin&quot;&nbsp; which is how far away the phase is from -180 degrees when 
the magnitude is at 0db.&nbsp; In this case the phase margin is 28 degrees.&nbsp; 
See the Bode Screen in the main Help section for more information</font></p>

(2 motor revs) and then a move back to the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; After each small
