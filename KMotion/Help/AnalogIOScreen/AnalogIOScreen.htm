<p>The <strong><em>Analog</em></strong><em><strong> I/O Status Screen</strong></em> displays various 
analog measurements and commands including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Measured +/10 V ADC inputs</li>
  <li>Measured current flow per axis</li>
  <li>Commanded +/10 V DAC outputs</li>
  <li>Commanded 0-4V DAC outputs</li>
  <li>Commanded PWM power amp settings</li>
  <li>Commanded Destinations of each axis</li>
  <li>Measured Position of each axis</li>
  <li>Status and Mode of each axis</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>KMotion</strong></em> has a number of 12-bit ADC and DAC channels that may be 
used either as servo channel inputs and outputs or as general purpose data 
acquisition and command signals. </p>

<h2><a name="ADCs">ADC's</a></h2>

<p><strong><em>KMotion's </em></strong>ADC channels may also be read by a host computer via 
the Console Script Command: ADCn, or by a on-board C program via the ADC(n) 
macro. These commands return ADC counts in the range of -2048 to 2047 
counts.</p>

<p>The first four of <em><strong>KMotion's</strong></em> eight on-board ADC channels are 
general purpose +/- 10V inputs. Note that in order for these to operate 
properly, the on-board 5V to +/- 15V power generation must be enabled. The input 
buffers are inverting such that nominally +10V corresponds to -2048 ADC counts, 
0 V corresponds to 0 ADC counts and -10V corresponds to +2047 ADC counts. 
See the input circuit <a href="../Schematics/Connectors.htm#Analog_I/O_circuit">
here</a>. Both the ADCs and DACs are designed to have slightly larger 
(nominally 2%) than +/- 10V range to account for component tolerance errors. 
In this way the ranges may always be scaled and offset to provide exact +/-10 V 
ranges. </p>

<p>Certain of <strong><em>KMotion's </em></strong>servo input modes allow ADC inputs as 
position information instead of digital encoder inputs. Such as <em>ADC 
Input mode</em> and <em>Resolver Input</em> modes. The <em>Resolver</em> servo 
input mode requires two ADC channels configured as sine and cosine signals. 
There are insufficient ADC channels for more than two axis to be configured as
<em>Resolver</em> input mode. When configuring an axis for a mode utilizing 
an ADC input the corresponding InputChannel(s) (0 and 1) for the axis must be 
set appropriately. Additionally, the corresponding Input Gains and Offsets 
for the axis may be used to correct for scale and offsets in either the ADC 
channels or the sensor itself.</p>

<p>Of <em><strong>KMotion's</strong></em> <em>eight</em> on-board ADC channels, <em>four</em> of 
the channels are dedicated to measuring current flow through each axis of the 
on-board power amplifiers. ADC Channels 4-7 normally corresponding to axis 
0-3 (if default <em>output channel</em> mapping is used). Since each axis 
consists of two full-bridge power amplifiers, the measured current per axis is 
the sum of <em>both</em> full bridges. This 
provides a convenient means to determine abnormal conditions such as stalled 
motors or open motor coils. This feature is designed to make an 
approximate measurement of axis current, not a precise measurement of axis 
current.</p>

<p>The range of current measurement is fixed at 
  nominally 0 - 4.85 Amps. Since each of <em><strong>KMotion's </strong></em>
  full bridge power amplifiers are rated for 3 Amps 
  continuous (per full bridge) and are normally utilized to drive a 4 phase motor 
  (such as a stepper motor), a worst case current per axis occurs when <em>both</em> 
  coils are conducting 0.707 of 3 Amps or 4.24 amps. The 4.85 Amp 
  range provides some margin beyond this. An zero current corresponds to an 
  ADC reading in counts of -2048 and 4.85Amps corresponds to an reading of +2047 
  counts.</p>

<p><a name="Small_bar_charts">Small bar charts</a> on the screen also provide an 
indication of current in each axis, see below. The graph displays a green 
bar from 0 to 100% full which corresponds to 0 to 3A of current. Currents 
higher than 3A show a full red bar which may indicate an over current situation 
if more than 3A is flowing in any one of the two full bridge circuits.</p>

<p><img src="Analog1.gif" /></p>

<h2><a name="DACs">DAC's</a></h2>

<p><strong><em>KMotion's </em></strong>DAC channels may be set by a host computer via the 
Console Script Command: DACn=x, or by a on-board C program via the DAC(n,x) 
macro. These commands set the DAC counts in the range of -2048 to 2047 
counts.</p>
<p>The first four of <em><strong>KMotion's</strong></em> eight on-board DAC channels are 
general purpose +/- 10V outputs. Note that in order for these to operate 
properly, the on-board 5V to +/- 15V power generation must be enabled. The 
output buffers are inverting such that nominally +10V corresponds to -2048 ADC 
counts, 0 V corresponds to 0 ADC counts and -10V corresponds to +2047 ADC counts 
(similar to the ADC readings). See the output circuit
<a href="../Schematics/Connectors.htm#Analog_I/O_circuit">here</a>. Both 
the ADCs and DACs are designed to have slightly larger (nominally 2%) than +/- 
10V range to account for component tolerance errors. In this way the 
ranges may always be scaled and offset to provide exact +/-10 V ranges. </p>
<p>The next four of <em><strong>KMotion's</strong></em> eight on-board DAC channels are 
general purpose 0 - 4V outputs. These outputs do <em>not</em> require the 
on-board 5V to +/- 15V power generation to be enabled. 0 V corresponds to -2048 
ADC counts and +4V corresponds to +2047 ADC counts. </p>

<h2><a name="PWMs">PWM's</a></h2>

<p>The state of <strong><em>KMotion's </em></strong>eight PWM (Pulse Width Modulators) are 
displayed in the top right area of the status screen. The PWM's are 
connected to on-board <em>Full Bridge Drivers</em> to allow direct control of 
various motors or loads. See the description of
<a href="../PWM_Description/PWM_Description.htm">KMotion's Power Amplifiers and 
PWM's</a> for details. The PWM's may operate independently to drive a full 
bridge driver, or they may function as a pair of PWM's connected to a pair of 
Full Bridge drivers to drive a
<a href="../PWM_Description/PWM_Description.htm#3_Phase_mode">3 phase load</a>. 
The default and recommended PWM assignment is to have:</p>
<p>Axis 0 configured to utilize PWM 0 and 1</p>
<p>Axis 1 configured to utilize PWM 2 and 3</p>
<p>Axis 2 configured to utilize PWM 4 and 5</p>
<p>Axis 3 configured to utilize PWM 6 and 7</p>

<p>However the PWMs may be reassigned by 
changing the OutputChan0 and OutputChan1 parameters for an axis. Only 
consecutive even and odd PWMS (0/1, 2/3, 4/5, or 6/7) may be paired to drive a 3 
phase load.</p>

<p>Therefore, there are three possible 
modes for each PWM channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal Independent</li>
  <li>Recirculating Independent</li>
  <li>3 Phase - paired</li>
</ul>

<p>If a PWM channel is operating in Normal mode, the PWM channel status will show the value in counts (-255 ... +255) and the percent of full scale.</p>

<p>If a PWM channel is operating in 
Recirculating mode, the PWM channel status will show the value in counts (-511 
... +511), followed by an &quot;R&quot;, and the percent of full scale.</p>

<p>If a pair of PWM channels is 
operating in 3 Phase mode, the PWM channel status will show the value in counts 
(-230 ... 230) after the first PWM channel and the phase angle in degrees after 
second PWM channel.</p>

<p>The example status below shows PWM 
channels 0 and 1 operating in 3 phase mode, PWM channels 2-5 operating in Normal 
mode, and PWM channels 6 and 7 operating in Recirculating mode.</p>


<p><img src="PWMStatus.PNG" width="115" height="158"></p>

<h2><a name="Dest">Dest</a></h2>

<p>This section of status displays the 
currently commanded destination for each axis. The Destination is the 
theoretically desired position for the axis. If a move is in progress, 
this is the current point along the desired trajectory of the motion. The 
units are in position units for the axis.</p>

<h2>Pos</strong></h2>

<p>This section of status displays the 
currently measured position for each axis. Depending on the input mode for 
the axis, this position may represent an encoder position, a resolver position, 
or an absolute position based on an ADC reading. An axis operating as an 
open loop microstepper mode may have no position sensor at all. In 
this case the position value is meaningless and ignored.</p>

<h2>Enable</h2>

<p>Displays whether an axis is enabled 
or not. Clicking on the Enabled checkbox will enable the axis if disabled 
or disable the axis if enabled.</p>

<h2><a name="Modes"></a>Modes</h2>

<p>Displays the currently configured 
input and output modes for each axis. The input mode determines what 
technique is used to determine the axis's measured position. The output 
mode determines how the axis's output should be driven.</p>

<p>Valid input modes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encoder</li>
  <li>ADC</li>
  <li>Resolver</li>
  <li>User Input</li>
</ul>

<p>Valid output modes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microstep</li>
  <li>DC Servo</li>
  <li>3PH Servo</li>
  <li>4PH Servo</li>
  <li>DAC Servo<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Done">Done</a></h2>


<p>Displays whether an axis operating as 
an independent axis (not a coordinated motion axis) has completed its last 
trajectory.</p>
