<h1>KMotion's Power Amplifiers and PWMs</h1>

<p>The basic component of <em><strong>KMotion's</strong></em> switching power amplifiers is 
the <em>Half Bridge</em> (see below). A half bridge allows one point to be 
connected to either Motor Power (V +) or ground by ether closing switch S1 or S2 
(but never both at the same time). The 4 Axis <em><strong>KMotion</strong></em> board 
contains a total of <em>sixteen</em> half bridges.</p>

<p><img src="../Schematics/HalfBridge.PNG" width="145" height="216" alt="Half Bridge" /></p>

<p>To control a simple 2 point load (such as one of the two coils of a stepper 
motor) two half bridges are connected into what is called a <em>Full Bridge</em> (or 
sometimes referred to as an <em>H Bridge</em>). </p>

<p><img src="../Schematics/FullBridge.PNG" width="208" height="186" alt="Full Bridge" /></p>

<p>By closing specific switches, voltage may be applied either direction to the 
load or the load may be shorted (which applies 0 volts across the load) and may 
allow current to recirculate through the load. See the 3 diagrams below. 
This technique is what allows <strong><em>KMotion</em></strong> to apply positive voltage, 
negative voltage, or zero voltage to a particular load using only a single 
positive supply. Furthermore, in order to provide a <em>variable</em> voltage to a 
load, a method of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is utilized which rapidly (@ 
~30KHz) switches between two of the three states. By varying the amount of 
time spent in the various states the average voltage that is applied to the load 
may be controlled.</p>

<p>There are two possible methods of performing PWM. <em><strong>KMotion</strong></em> refers to the two 
methods as <em>Normal</em> (in some literature this is referred to as locked 
anti-phase) or <em>Recirculating. </em></p>

<p>The <em>Normal</em> method always switches between the first two states shown 
below (positive and negative). If the desired average voltage is <em>
positive</em>, then the positive state will be applied for a <em>longer</em> time 
than the negative state. If the desired average voltage is <em>negative</em>, 
then the positive state will be applied for a <em>shorter</em> time than the 
negative state. For example, if +50% of the supply voltage is desired, 
then 75% of the time positive will be applied, and 25% of the time negative will 
be applied. Note that if the desired average voltage is <em>zero</em>, then 
the positive state will be applied for an equal time as the negative state. 
The advantage of this method is that the controlled voltage is very linear 
through zero. The slight disadvantage of this method is somewhat larger 
current ripple. Current ripple also becomes larger as the load inductance 
decreases. Most motors have relatively large inductances so this method 
works well and provides the best performance. However for loads with 
little or no inductance (such as a light bulb) this method is inappropriate as 
full current will always flow regardless of the +/- duty cycle.</p>

<p>The <em>Recirculating </em>method always switches between the zero state and <em>
either</em> the positive state <em>or</em> the negative state depending on whether 
the desired voltage is either positive or negative. For example, if +50% 
of the supply voltage is desired, then 50% of the time <em>positive</em> will be 
applied, and 50% of the time <em>zero</em> will be applied. Note that if the 
desired average voltage is <em>zero</em>, then the zero state will be applied 100% 
of the time. This might be considered more of a true &quot;off&quot; condition, than 
the above method which switches equally between positive and negative. The 
advantage of this method is that there is less current ripple and will even work 
with non inductive loads (like a light bulb). The disadvantage of this 
method is the slight nonlinearity through zero that occurs when transitioning 
from a very short positive pulse to a very short negative pulse. Every 
real switch has a minimum turn on and turn off period which limits the smallest 
size of a pulse.</p>

<p><em><strong>KMotion</strong></em> also has a <em><a name="3_Phase_mode">3 Phase mode</a></em> 
where two full bridges (only 1/2 of the second is used) and two PWM timers work 
in a special configuration in order to drive a 3 phase brushless motor. 
See the circuit configuration below. Here the supply voltage may be 
effectively applied at any phase angle (direction toward any of the 3 loads). 
The method utilized is analogous to the <em>Normal</em> mode described above and 
has smooth transitions through reversals.</p>
