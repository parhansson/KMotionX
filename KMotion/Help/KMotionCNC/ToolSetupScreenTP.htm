<p>The Tool Setup Screen allows <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> to be configured for a 
particular machine tool. Each machine tool is likely to have different 
motion resolution, speeds, and acceleration limits. It is also likely to 
different I/O requirements with regard to Spindle control and such. 
Additionally a machine may have different initialization and homing 
requirements. <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> has a flexible mechanism for defining what 
type of action is to be performed for various M Codes and Custom Buttons.</p>

<h2><a name="Trajectory_Planner">Trajectory Planner</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/TrajectoryPlanner.png" alt="Trajectory Planner" /></p>

<p><strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> contains a powerful Trajectory Planner. The 
Trajectory Planner utilizes a &quot;break angle&quot; concept to decide when a stop must 
be made. Vectors that are in the same direction within the &quot;break angle&quot; 
are traversed without stopping. When a &quot;sharp&quot; angle is detected a 
complete stop will be made before beginning on the next vector. The Break 
Angle Parameter allows the user to specify the angle in degrees that will be 
considered a &quot;sharp&quot; angle. <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> considers the change 
in direction in 3 dimensions (x,y,z ignoring a). The Trajectory 
Planner is capable of optimizing the acceleration and deceleration through many 
short (or long) vectors all of which may have different acceleration and 
velocity limitations.</p>

<p>The Trajectory Planner also has a &quot;<a name="lookahead">lookahead</a>&quot; parameter. With 
  <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> the G Code Program itself, the G Code Interpreter, and the Trajectory 
Planner all reside within the PC running Microsoft Windows™. 
Since the Microsoft Windows™ is <em>not</em> a 
real-time OS, a certain amount of motion must be buffered in the motion 
controller to handle the cases where the PC program doesn't have a chance to 
execute for a while. These time periods are typically very short (a few 
milliseconds), but in some extreme cases may occasionally be as long as one or 
several seconds. The worst case is often a factor of the hardware (disk 
network adapters, etc) and associated drivers that are loaded into the system. 
The lookahead parameter is used to determine how much motion, in terms of time, 
should be downloaded to the motion controller <em>before</em> actual motion is 
initiated. Furthermore, after motion has begun, the lookahead 
parameter is used to pause the trajectory planner to avoid having the Trajectory 
Planner get too far ahead of the actual motion. The disadvantage of having 
the Trajectory Planner get too far ahead is that if the User decides to override 
the feed rate, since the motion has already been planned and downloaded, the 
rate will not be changed quickly. A value of 3 seconds is very 
conservative on most systems. If more responsive feed rate override is 
desirable, an experiment with a smaller value might be made.</p>
<p>&quot;Collinear Tolerance&quot; allows GCode blocks that are nearly 
linear, to be combined into a single linear segment to allow faster and smoother 
motion. Often GCode programs generated by 3D CAD systems contain very 
small vectors that appear jagged or noisy due to numerical round off errors . 
See below for an example of a small GCode fragment from an intended circle. 
The 0.3 inch diameter circle was divided into 10,000 sides each only 0.0001 
inches in length. Intuitively one would think this would result in an 
extremely smooth contour. Ironically, rounding off to 4 decimal 
digits introduces &quot;noise&quot; that results in sharp angles and each axis being 
required to repeatedly stop and start. Even with quite high acceleration, 
stopping and starting over short distances results in extremely low average 
speed and most likely a rough surface. A combined segment shown below in 
blue will result in a faster and smoother motion.</p>

<p>Segments are combined as long as all intermediate 
waypoints do not deviate from the combined segment by more than the allowed 
collinear tolerance. Setting the collinear tolerance to zero will disallow 
any segments from being combined. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The &quot;Arcs To Segments&quot; option allows circular arcs that 
were specified in the original GCode to be replaced by a number of linear 
segments. Each arc will be recursively subdivided until any cord error 
deviation from the original path is less than the Collinear Tolerance parameter. 
Sub dividing the arc (actually a helix) into line segments allows the path 
motion to be more fully optimized by the Trajectory Planner. This is 
because as the motion progresses through the arc the direction changes. As 
the direction changes the different axes become involved and also work together 
in different ways (diagonal directions make use of more than one axis). 
This means constraints (max velocity and acceleration) vary throughout the arc. 
With individual line segments the Trajectory planner is able to use optimal 
acceleration and velocity throughout the arc. When Arcs To Segments is not 
selected the entire arc may be treated as a single entity and will use the 
most limited velocity and acceleration constraints throughout the arc for the 
entire arc. If the feed rate is slow and curvature based accelerations are 
small relative to the axis limits then there will be little performance increase 
in using segments.</p>

<p>When the &quot;Arcs To Segments&quot; Option is selected the 
Collinear Tolerance must be larger than zero. Care should be used in 
selecting a Collinear Tolerance so that an excessive number of segments is not 
generated. The number of segments increases as the square root of the 
inverse of the Collinear Tolerance (cutting the tolerance in half increase the 
number of segments by 40%).</p>

and Corner Tolerance and Facet Angle see <a href="TrajectoryPlanner.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Jog_Speeds">Jog Speeds</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/Slow Percentage.png" alt="Jog Speeds" /></p>

<p>Defines the Jog Speeds for both the Jog Buttons and any attached Gamepad 
controller.These  speeds are the maximum Jog speeds which are indicated by the outer jog arrow  buttons (Jog Fast) or the GamePad joystick fully depressed. The user can define a slower speed as a percentage of the fast speed. See Also
<a href="KMotionCNC.htm#Jog_Buttons">Jog Buttons</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Step_Increments">Step Increments</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/StepIncrements.PNG" alt="Step Increments" /></p>

<p>Defines the step size distances for the Step Buttons that are displayed on 
the main <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> Screen. Setting a step size to zero will hide 
the size selection. The <em>Enable Gamepad</em> checkbox allows you to enable or disable a gamepad. Some systems falsely indicate that they have a gamepad installed, which may cause errors. In these cases, uncheck the<em> Enable Gamepad</em> checkbox. See Also <a href="KMotionCNC.htm#Jog_Buttons">Jog Buttons</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Lathe_Options">Lathe Options</a></h2>
<p>
<img src="KMotionCNCfiles/LatheOptions.png" alt="Lathe Options" /></p>

<p>Defines options relating to Lathe systems. </p>
<p>Selecting the Lathe option orients the Jog Buttons and 
default GViewer orientations to have +Z horizontal to the right and with X 
vertical as most Lathe systems are configured. The &quot;X Positive Front&quot; 
rotates the axes system (and X Jog Keys) so that the tool moves toward the front 
of the system as X increases. This is more suitable for cutting tools 
mounted on the front side of the spindle. Otherwise the tool moves toward 
the back as X increases. This is more suitable for rear mounted tools.</p>

<p><strong>X Positive Rear</strong></p>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/LathePosFront.png" alt="X Positive Front" /></p>

<p>When Diameter Mode is selected the Gcode X Units, X Offset 
Units, and X DRO Units are all in terms of diameter. In this mode actual 
tool cutter motion is 1/2 the specified value so the the total diameter of the 
cut part is the specified value. When Diameter Mode is not selected, 
Radius mode will be used, the tool cutter motion will be the specified value, 
and the cut part will have a radius of the specified value in the GCode. </p>

<h2><a name="Feed_Rate_Override">Feed Rate Override</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/FeedRateOverride.png" width="247" height="61" alt="Feed Rate Override" /></p>

<p>The Hardware Range value allows control over what part of 
the Feed Rate Override (FRO) Range is handled by Hardware, and what part is handled by 
Software (Trajectory Planner). </p>
<p>Hardware FRO has the advantage of having instant response, 
however it has a disadvantage of having accelerations distorted by time warping. 
Accelerations will be distorted by the square of the FRO setting. For 
example a FRO of 2.0 will result in accelerations 4X higher than planned. 
Hardware FRO can be thought of like playing a movie back in fast or slow motion. 
Another analogy might be a car that plans a trajectory accelerating from 0 to 
60MPH in 10 seconds. Played at double time (FRO=2.0) would result in 
acceleration from 0 to 120MPH in 5 seconds! Similarly feed rates through 
tight curves will be proportionally increased by the FRO possibly resulting 
in excessive acceleration. Velocities are also increased proportionally by 
the Hardware FRO. This is obviously the normal intention, however speeds 
at or near the maximum possible for the system may now exceed the capabilities 
of the system. This also applies for Rapid (G0) motions. Any 
Hardware FRO value higher than 1.0 must have maximum system settings set in a manner 
that accelerations and velocities have sufficient margins to allow this 
increased acceleration and velocity. </p>
<p>Hardware FRO values less than 1.0 will be distorted in the 
opposite manner. Accelerations will be unnecessarily slow. In the 
previous car analogy played at slow motion (FRO=0.5) the car would accelerate 
from 0 to 30MPH in 20 seconds. Motions through tight curves will be 
proportionally slowed down regardless if a higher speed might be possible and 
closer to the desired feed rate. Hardware FRO values less than 1.0 
will never cause a maximum acceleration or velocity limit to be exceeded.</p>
<p>Software FRO always provides the optimal motion without ever exceeding any system constraint. Maximum Accelerations and 
Velocities on all axes will always be honored. Accelerations to feed rate 
will always be optimized. Speeds through curves will always be optimal. 
However such optimized Trajectory Planning is complex and requires look ahead 
and results in some delayed response to changes. Reducing
<a href="#lookahead">lookahead</a> can minimize this delay. </p>
<p>The FRO Hardware Range Parameter sets the boundary FRO 
value where values below the setting will be handled by Hardware, and values 
above the setting will be handled by Software. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Hardware Range = 0.0 will cause <em>all</em> FRO values to be 
handled by Software. </p>
<p>Hardware Range = 100.0 (a huge value) will result in 
<em>all</em> FRO values being handled by Hardware. </p>
<p>Hardware Range = 1.0 will cause all values less than 1.0 
to be handled by Hardware and values greater than 1.0 to be handled in Software. 
This is the largest value that will never cause the set values of Max 
Acceleration or Max Velocity set in the Trajectory Planner to be exceeded.</p>
<p>Hardware range = 1.2 will cause all values less than 1.2 
to be handled by Hardware and values greater than 1.2 to be handled in Software. 
This setting is useful if it is required to have minor increases (+20%) and 
all decreases have an instant effect. However this requires that the set 
values of Max Acceleration or Max Velocity set in the Trajectory Planner be set by a 
factor of 1/1.2<sup>2</sup> = 0.69 of the system capabilities in order 
to provide margin to allow for the Hardware FRO.</p>
<p>Hardware Range = 0.5 will cause all values less than 0.5 
to be handled by Hardware, and values greater than 0.5 to be handled in Software. 
In most cases this will result in a similar result as Hardware Range = 0.0 (with 
all changes handled by Software). However in cases for example where the FRO is 
suddenly reduced from 1.0 to 0.25 the system will first reduce the FRO to 0.5 in 
Software, and then the remainder, another factor of 0.5 in Hardware. The 
Software effect will be delayed but the hardware effect will be instant. 
This provides most all of the benefits of Software FRO in the normal ranges of (ie 
0.9 - 1.1) while also allowing a means of instantly slowing down.</p>

<h2><a name="Max_Rapid_FRO">Max Rapid FRO</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/MaxRapidFRO.png" width="198" height="30" alt="Max Rapid FRO" /></p>

<p>Limits the Rapid FRO to the specified value. Rapid 
FRO is always performed in hardware so values Rapid FRO values greater than 1.0 
will exceed the specified Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk specified in KFLOP. 
Use this limit to avoid FRO values that would cause Velocities, 
Accelerations, or Jerks that the system would be incapable of performing. 
This value is commonly set to 1.0 if the parameters specified in KFLOP are set 
at the maximum possible. To allow FRO values greater than 1.0 the system 
must have sufficient margin to be able to exceed the specified parameters. 
Values less than 1.0 are not commonly specified.</p>

<h2><a name="Rapids_as_Feeds">Rapids as Feeds</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/RapidsAsFeeds.png" width="149" height="26" alt="Rapids as Feeds" /></p>

<p>Selects whether Rapids are performed as 3rd-order (Jerk 
limited) motions or 2nd order Feed Motions. Most systems will not select 
this option so that Rapids are performed as faster/smoother 3rd-order 
Jerk-Limited motions. However KFLOP performs 3rd order Rapids as a single 
linear interpolated multi-axis motion at the actuator level. This is fine 
for normal Cartesian xyz linear systems however may cause problems for highly 
non-linear kinematic systems as a straight line in actuator space is not likely 
to be a straight line in real CAD space. For example a Delta Platform is 
an example of a non-linear system. This may result in a rapid motion path 
from one point to another to be along a somewhat unpredictable curved path. 
In some cases this may result in an undesirable crash.
<a href="GeoCorrection.htm">Geometric Correction</a> is also a form of 
nonlinearity. However Geometric correction is usually not sufficiently 
non-linear to cause problems unless long rapids are performed passing very close 
to part surfaces or features. If nonlinearity is an issue for your system, 
select this option and Rapids will always be performed along a straight line as 
they will be subdivided into small segments where proper actuator positions are 
calculated to keep the motion along a straight line. Regardless of whether 
this option is selected or not the Velocity and Acceleration will be set by the 
KFLOP Axis Parameters not by the current GCode Feed Rate or Trajectory Planner 
Settings.</p>

<p>Zero/Set Buttons near DROs allow the User to Set the DRO

<p>This option causes the <strong><em>KMotionCNC</em></strong> Drop Down Tool Selector 
to immediately select and apply the Tool Length (and offsets) Compensation 
without having to select and turn on the compensation in GCode with &quot;HxxxxG43&quot;.</p>

<p>The GCode indirectly specifies the Start of the Arc (previous position), the End of the Arc (Specified Position), and the Arc Center Point (Previous Position + IJK offset). The distance between the Start to the Center and the End to the Center should be the same. Specifies the allowed Tolerance the GCode Interpreter will allow between the beginning and ending radius of an arc. This should be a very small number within the rounding tolerance of the numbers.</p>

<h2><a name="arc-radius-small" id="arc-beg-end2">Arc radius small Tol</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/ArcRadiusSmallTol.png" width="295" height="28" border="0"></p>

<h2><a name="Axis_Motion_Parameters">Axis Motion Parameters</a></h2>

<p><img src="KMotionCNCfiles/AxisParams.png" aly="Axis Motion Parameters"/></p>

<p>The Axis Motion Parameters define the scale, maximum feed velocities, and 
maximum feed accelerations for each of the six axis.  </p>
<p>The first parameter is the axis's scale in counts/inch. For the example 
value of 100 shown, <em><strong>KMotionCNC</strong></em> will command the motion controller to move 
100 counts for each inch of motion in the G Code Program. This value is 
always in counts/inch regardless of the units used in the interpreter. <em>
<strong>KMotionCNC</strong></em> will automatically perform any conversions.</p>
<p>The second parameter is the maximum allowed feed rate for the axis in 
inches/sec. Note that the G Code Interpreter Feed Rate is defined in 
inches per minute or (mm per minute) so be aware of the different time units. 
These are <em>maximum</em> feed rates for each axis. If a vector tool motion 
at a particular feed rate has any component velocity that exceeds the 
corresponding axis's maximum velocity, the feed rate for the vector will be 
reduced so that all axes remain at or below their maximum allowed velocity.</p>
<p>The third parameter is the maximum allowed acceleration for the axis in 
inches/sec<sup>2</sup>. The G Code Language has no provisions for 
specifying acceleration rates. Therefore the acceleration (and 
deceleration) along a vector used will always be the largest acceleration such 
that each axis's acceleration is at or below the specified limit.</p>
<p>The velocity and acceleration limits apply only to linear and circular   feed motions (G1, G2, G3). Rapid motions (G0) use the settings in the   motion controller (velocity, acceleration, and Jerk) to move all axes   from one point to another along a straight line as quickly as possible   without violating any axis involved in the motion constraints.&nbsp; To   change the speed of G0 Rapid motions change the axes configuration settings in the motion controller. </p>
<p>Axes A,B,C sometimes are angular axes and are programmed 
to move angles of degrees rather than linear distances. If so select 
&quot;Degrees&quot; so that the axis moves in degrees regardless of the Inch or mm modes 
in GCode. </p>
<p>The best method for performing coordinated linear and 
angular combined motion is to use G93 Inverse Time Mode. This mode allows 
the CAD system to generate GCode that will cause the feed rate at the tool to 
always be at the desired feed rate based on the geometry of the system. 
However this requires a time (specified by its inverse) for each GCode block to 
be computed and included in the data stream. If Inverse TIme GCode 
data is not available a Radius for each Angular Axis can be specified. 
This allows the Trajectory planner to convert angular motion rates to linear 
motion rates. This assumes that the tool will remain at a relatively 
constant radius from the rotation axis (ie. engraving on a cylinder). 
Whenever Degrees is specified with a non-zero radius then the Trajectory Planner 
will consider the motion for that axis to be at the equivalent radius and 
orthogonal to all other combined motions.</p>
<p>As an example for the settings shown above for Axis A the 
maximum linear Velocity and Acceleration rates are the same as X, Y, and Z 
assuming a 10 inch radius about the A Axis of rotation.</p>
<p>57.295 deg/sec x &#960;/180deg x 10in = 10in/sec</p>
<p>229.183 deg/sec<sup>2</sup> x &#960;/180deg x 10in = 40in/sec<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The GCode sequence shown below will perform a G1 Feed a 
linear distance of 10 inches in both X and A. Because the X and A axis are 
assumed to be orthogonal the combined distance will be assumed to be 14.1 inches 
total. At a feed rate of 60 ipm = 1 ips, the total Feed Time will be 14.1 
sec (plus a small acceleration time).</p>

<p>Spindle Speed measurement is supported as well as Single Point Threading. 
		A quadrature encoder is required on the spindle. Specify the 
		Sensor Type as 1 to enable the Spindle measurement. Configure the 
		Axis Channel that is configured to read the encoder (Note this is not 
		the encoder channel, rather it is the axis that has the encoder channel 
		configured as its input). Specify the Update time, Tau, and 
		counts/rev. See <a href="../Cmd.htm#ConfigSpindle">here</a> for 
	  more information. </p>
