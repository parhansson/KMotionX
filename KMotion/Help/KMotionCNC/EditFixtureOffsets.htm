<p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Edit Fixture Offsets</font></i></b></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="KMotionCNCfiles/EditFixturesDialog.png"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Edit Fixture Offsets Screen allows editing, clearing, 
and saving the 9 fixture offsets (sometimes referred to as Work Offsets) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">The currently selected Fixture Offset is highlighted with 
&quot;***&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Besides the active Fixture Offset there is also a Global 
Offset (G92).&nbsp; The commanded Machine Position will be computed as:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Machine Position&nbsp; =&nbsp; GCode 
Program 
Position&nbsp; +&nbsp; Active Fixture Offset&nbsp; +&nbsp; Global Offset</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Clear ALL&quot; can be used to clear all 9 Fixture offsets to 
zero.&nbsp; Individual &quot;Clear&quot; Buttons will clear single offsets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fixture offsets are saved into the GCode Variables file.&nbsp; 
If saved they will be restored the next time KMotionCNC is started.&nbsp; The file 
used to save the GCode Variables can be specified in the
<a href="ToolSetupScreenFiles.htm">Tool Setup</a>.&nbsp; When Variables are 
saved to disk the file must already exist which determines which variables are to be 
saved.&nbsp; The file is read and all the variables present in the file will be 
replaced with their current values.&nbsp; Variables 5221-5226 contain the XYZABC 
coordinates of the first fixture offset.&nbsp; Skip 20 variables for each successive 
fixture.&nbsp; Global Offsets are saved in Vars 5211-5216.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that the Setup File can also set various settings 
including offsets and will override values loaded from the Vars file.&nbsp; If 
you do not wish certain parameters to be forced to specific values on startup, 
make sure to remove them from the <a href="ToolSetupScreenFiles.htm#Setup_File">
Setup file</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected any changes made will be discarded 
and the dialog will exit 
- however if &quot;Save&quot; was used the values at the time of selecting Save will 
remain in the Disk File.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Select &quot;OK&quot; to apply any changes that were made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that Fixture offsets are in units of Inches or mm.&nbsp; 
It is up to the Operator to be in the proper corresponding units mode when 
selecting/changing Fixture offsets.&nbsp; The System must be in the proper 
corresponding units before selecting a Fixture.&nbsp; After a fixture has been 
selected the Units may then be changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fixture Offsets can also be changed from within GCode 
using G10.&nbsp; For example:</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">G20 (inches mode)<br>
F30<br>
G10L2P1X0Y0Z0 (Set G54 offset to 0,0,0 used by default) <br>
G10L2P2X2Y0Z0 (Set G55 offset to 2,0,0)<br>
G10L2P3X0Y2Z0 (Set G55 offset to 0,2,0)<br>
<br>
G54 (Set to coordinate system 1 - already by default)<br>
G0 x0y0z0 (Draw a box) <br>
