<p>Shown below is a plotted motion of 400 cycles (1600 full steps) with quite 
gradual acceleration up to a velocity of 255 cycles/sec (1000 sps)</p>
<p>A noise from the motor is heard during about the middle half of the motion.&nbsp; 
Here the motor position and current in both stepper coils is plotted.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Zooming in on the beginning of the motion shows nice current waveforms 90 
degrees out of phase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a plot of the Velocity and the commanded output Voltage of one of the 
coils.&nbsp; Note how as the Velocity increases the lead compensation (set at 
55) increases the amplitude.&nbsp; Referring back to the first current plot 
above we can see that the current amplitude is maintained at about 1.4 amps 
throughout the motion.&nbsp; Showing the lead compensation is set properly.</p>

<p>Zooming in on the current waveform at around 1 second where the motor noise 
seems to begin.</p>

<p>Zooming still further at 0.98 seconds where the odd behavior seems most 
pronounced.</p>

<p>Current Waveforms with no Lead - Current drops and motor immediately stalls</p>
