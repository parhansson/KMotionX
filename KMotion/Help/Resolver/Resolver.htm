is a video overview</a>.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ResolverMovie.jpg" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">This example configuration shows a Resolver used as a 
KMotion input device.&nbsp; A Resolver serves a purpose much like a digital 
encoder.&nbsp; A Resolver is physically somewhat similar to a transformer with 
two output windings called sine and cosine outputs.&nbsp; For a given excitation 
input, the amplitude of the sine output is proportional to the sine of the 
mechanical rotor position, and the amplitude of the cosine output is 
proportional the the cosine of the mechanical rotor position.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 
driving the excitation coil of a Resolver and measuring the amplitude of the 
sine and cosine outputs, the mechanical rotor position can be determined.&nbsp; 
Although a Resolver is an analog device there are some significant advantages.&nbsp; 
A resolver is a high reliability device originally developed for military 
applications.&nbsp; Because a Resolver is able to determine the rotor position 
in an absolute manner for an entire shaft revolution it is not possible to 
&quot;lose&quot; position of a fraction of a shaft revolution, as with an encoder.&nbsp; 
If the position is &quot;lost&quot; it must be lost&nbsp; by a complete multiple of an 
entire shaft rotation.&nbsp; Often older CNC systems used Resolvers as their 
feedback device.&nbsp; When using KMotion to retrofit an older system with 
resolvers, because KMotion may be used with resolvers, it is not necessary to 
modify the original system to change to digital encoders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note: many older systems used a resolver in a somewhat reverse manner.&nbsp; 
The controller excited the sine and cosine coils in a manner such that third 
coil would generate a signal proportional to the <i>difference</i> between the 
desired rotor position and the actual rotor position.&nbsp; This difference was 
then used to directly drive the servo motors to reduce the error.&nbsp; 
Operating in this manner the controller has no information on the actual rotor 
position or&nbsp; the following error between the desired and actual rotor 
positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resolver originally used in this manner may still 
be used in the manner described in this example.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shown below is a schematic symbol of a Resolver. The arrow 
indicates a varying coupling between the excitation input and the output coils 
as a function of rotor angle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ResolverSymbol.PNG" width="480" height="424"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is a typical resolver unit (manufactured by Singer) with 6 wires, two 
for each of the three coils.&nbsp; The wiring of a resolver can usually be 
determined using a simple ohmmeter.&nbsp; The ohm meter can be used to determine 
which pair of wires belong to a coil.&nbsp; Furthermore the sine and cosine 
coils should have a very similar resistance and usually different from the 
excitation coil.&nbsp; In the resolver shown below the excitation coil has a 
resistance of 20 ohms and the sine/cosine oils have a resistance of 37 ohms.&nbsp; 
Swapping the sine and cosine coils will simply reverse the measured motion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ResolverCloseup.JPG" width="410" height="343"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Resolvers may be interfaced to KMotion in one of two ways.&nbsp; One method 
is where an external circuit or module is available to excite the resolver and 
determine the sine and cosine magnitudes externally.&nbsp; In this case only the 
sine and cosine magnitude signals need to be connected to ADC inputs and 
&quot;Resolver&quot; input mode can be selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For further information 
regarding this interface method see the Configuration Screen Setup.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A second method is where KMotion performs the excitation and synchronously 
samples the AC outputs to determine and track the Resolver position.&nbsp; The 
second method doesn't require an external Resolver Control Module or control 
circuit.&nbsp; Only a single diode and two filter capacitors are required.&nbsp; 
This is the method used in this example configuration.&nbsp; The method does 
require a KMotion User Program (shown below written in C) to switch the resolver 
excitation on and off and to sample the output waveforms at the appropriate 
times to determine the amplitudes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">KMotion's Aux Switch output is used in this example to excite the resolver's 
input coil with a 5V square wave.&nbsp; +5V is applied to one end of the coil 
and the Aux Switch drives the opposite end of the coil to ground.&nbsp; This 
applies +5V to the coil which causes current to ramp up in the coil.&nbsp; When 
the switch is turned off, current is allowed to recirculate through a diode 
which will cause the current to ramp down due to the coil's internal resistance.&nbsp; 
This processes is repeated every 4 User Program Time Slices (180us each) or 
every 720us (1.4KHz).&nbsp; The User Program computes the resolver position on 
both the positive and negative transitions so the effective update rate is 2.8 
KHz.&nbsp; This Aux Switch output, and single diode, may be used to drive 
several resolvers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The two output coils of each resolver are each connected to an ADC input with 
the other ends of the coils connected to ground.&nbsp; 0.2uF filter capacitors 
are used to smooth the output waveforms and should be located near the KMotion 
Board.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The example layout below shows the connections for a single resolver.&nbsp; 
Because KMotion has only 4 ADC inputs, KMotion is limited to interfacing to two 
resolvers.&nbsp; If more axes are required then digital encoders must be used.&nbsp; 
For testing purposes a small DC torque motor is shown connected to the resolver.&nbsp; 
The DC motor is driven from one PWM output using the +12V supply.&nbsp; A more 
likely scenario for an actual CNC retrofit would be to use the existing motor 
power amplifiers driven by KMotion's +/-10V DAC outputs.&nbsp; </font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">A wiring diagram for a complete 2 axis resolver is shown below.&nbsp; Also 
shown is the DAC output connections for connecting to external power amplifiers 
with +/-10 V Inputs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="ResolverWiring.PNG" width="1196" height="812"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is a KMotion User Program which basically loops every 4 time slices 
(720us), switches the 5V excitation, samples the ADC readings, computes the 
output magnitudes, and calls an internal function (DoResolverInput2) that 
computes the rotor angle and updates the axis's Position.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
DoResolverInput2 internally multiplies the measured angle (in Radians) by 
1000/(2 pi) so that 1 shaft revolution will be seen as 1000.0 counts.&nbsp; This 
causes numeric values to have similar ranges as with digital encoders. </font> </p>
